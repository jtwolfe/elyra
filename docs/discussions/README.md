## Purpose

This folder contains **imported external discussion documents** (notes, chats, drafts) that informed the architecture redesign work.

- These files are **references**, not necessarily current truth.
- The canonical “what we’re building” docs should live under `docs/concepts/` (to be created as we synthesize).

## Index

- `esp-loop-mesh-memory-architecture-v1.md` (2025-12-11, Grok 4 / xAI): earliest ESP Loop Mesh memory architecture draft.
- `esp-loop-memory-architecture-v1.md` (2025-12-11, Grok 4 / xAI): ESP Loop Memory architecture with Podman swarm runtime, metacognition quorum, reconciliation agent.
- `esp-loop-architectures-comparison-2025-12-11.md` (2025-12-11): structured comparison and unification recommendations.
- `hybrid-esp-loop-mesh-architecture-diagram.puml`: PlantUML diagram for a hybrid architecture (agents + mesh + Podman + RL hooks).
- `neuroscience-review-hybrid-esp-loop-mesh-2025-12-11.md` (2025-12-11): neuroscientific mapping and LMM/LCM conceptual models.
- `lmm-lcm-internal-structures-estimate-2025-12-11.md` (2025-12-11): further elaboration on LMM/LCM internals and dynamic vs static tradeoffs.
- `esp-loop-simple-implementation-2025-12-23.md` (2025-12-23): laptop/server-friendly prototype loop (Chroma/Lance + Ollama) with pruning and micro-agents.
- `esp-loop-advanced-implementation-2025-12-23.md` (2025-12-23): DGX Spark / vLLM continuous inference concept (KV-cache memory + SNN + RL pruning).
- `cognitive-braid-ideal-ai-architecture-report.md`: “Cognitive braid” metaphor for an “ideal AI” architecture (perception/memory/cognition/action + meta strand), influenced by LMM/LCM concepts.

## Notes

- The “ESP Loop Mesh Memory Architecture Document” was re-shared later in the discussion; we keep a single canonical imported copy (`esp-loop-mesh-memory-architecture-v1.md`) to avoid duplicating identical content.
- The “ESP Loop Memory Architecture Document” was also re-shared; canonical imported copy is `esp-loop-memory-architecture-v1.md`.
