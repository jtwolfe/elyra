## Purpose

This folder contains **imported external discussion documents** (notes, chats, drafts) that informed the architecture redesign work.

- These files are **references**, not necessarily current truth.
- The canonical “what we’re building” docs should live under `docs/concepts/` (to be created as we synthesize).

## Index

- `esp-loop-mesh-memory-architecture-v1.md` (2025-12-11, Grok 4 / xAI): earliest ESP Loop Mesh memory architecture draft.
- `esp-loop-memory-architecture-v1.md` (2025-12-11, Grok 4 / xAI): ESP Loop Memory architecture with Podman swarm runtime, metacognition quorum, reconciliation agent.

## Notes

- The “ESP Loop Mesh Memory Architecture Document” was re-shared later in the discussion; we keep a single canonical imported copy (`esp-loop-mesh-memory-architecture-v1.md`) to avoid duplicating identical content.
