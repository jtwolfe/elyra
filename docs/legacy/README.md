## Legacy docs (superseded)

Everything under `docs/legacy/` is preserved for historical reference only.

- The canonical architecture and contracts are documented under `docs/v2/`.
- External discussion materials that informed the redesign live under `docs/discussions/`.

If you are trying to understand or implement the current direction of Elyra, start at `docs/v2/README.md`.
